# H1N1 Vaccination Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the H1N1 flu vaccine. By identifying key factors that influence vaccination decisions, we can enhance public health strategies, tailor vaccination campaigns more effectively, and improve overall vaccination rates.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholder Audience
Our primary stakeholders include:

Public Health Authorities: They are responsible for designing and implementing vaccination programs. By understanding vaccination trends, they can focus their efforts on high-risk groups and optimize resource allocation.

Policymakers: They need data-driven insights to create effective health policies and regulations aimed at increasing vaccination uptake.

Healthcare Providers: They can use predictive models to identify individuals or communities at higher risk and ensure these groups receive targeted education and vaccination outreach.
Dataset Choice

## Data Understanding
The datasets used for this project include:

Training Set Features: Contains various features related to individuals' demographic information, behavioral responses, and health beliefs.
Training Set Labels: Contains the vaccination status (H1N1 vaccine and seasonal flu vaccine) for the individuals in the training set features.
## Data Summary
Training Set Features: Includes columns such as respondent_id, h1n1_concern, h1n1_knowledge, behavioral indicators (e.g., behavioral_antiviral_meds, behavioral_avoidance), and demographic information (e.g., age_group, education, race, sex).
Training Set Labels: Contains the columns respondent_id, h1n1_vaccine, and seasonal_vaccine.

## Modeling
### Methodology
The modeling process involves several key steps:

Data Preprocessing: This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Additional features may be created based on existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training: Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are trained using the preprocessed data.
Model Selection: The best model is selected based on its performance on validation data.

### Models Used
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

### Evaluation
#### Metrics
The models are evaluated using several performance metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
Precision: The proportion of positive identifications that are actually correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.
AUC-ROC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### Results
Random Forest: Showed good accuracy and recall, highlighting its ability to handle complex interactions between features.
Gradient Boosting: Delivered the best overall performance with the highest accuracy and AUC-ROC, indicating strong predictive capability.

### Conclusion
The H1N1 vaccination prediction project successfully identified key factors influencing vaccination uptake and developed a predictive model to aid public health efforts. The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the best-performing model, offering significant insights for targeted vaccination campaigns. These findings can help public health authorities and policymakers design more effective vaccination strategies, ultimately improving public health outcomes.
